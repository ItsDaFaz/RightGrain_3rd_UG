Eggplant, aubergine, or brinjal is a plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae, Solanum melongena, grown for its often purple edible fruit.
<br><br>
The spongy, absorbent fruit of the plant is widely used in cooking in many different cuisines, and is often considered a vegetable, even though it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it is related to the tomato and the potato. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but, like the potato, it is not advisable to eat it raw. Eggplant supplies low contents of macronutrients and micronutrients. The capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking is well known in the culinary arts.

It was originally domesticated from the wild nightshade species thorn or bitter apple, S. incanum,probably with two independent domestications: one in South Asia, and one in East Asia.

    Soil and Field Preparation
    <br><br>
    The brinjal can be grown in all types of soil varying from light sandy to heavy clay. Light soils are good for an early yield, while clay-loam and silt-loam are well suited for higher yield. Loam and sandy soil of normal and higher status are best suited for brinjal cultivation. The soil should fertile and well drained. Brinjal is very hardy crop and can be grown even in adverse conditions like in soil having high pH Brinjal has great adoptability
    <br><br>
    Since the crop remain in the field for a number of months. The soil should be thoroughly prepared by ploughing 4 to 5 times before transplanting the seedlings. Bulky organic manures like well rotten crowding or compost should be incorporated evenly on the soil
    <br><br>
    Manure and Fertilizers
    <br><br>
    Brinjal is a heavy feeder crop. Therefore a balance application of manure and    fertilizers is very important for important for successful crop production. Further the brinjal being a long duration crop requires a good amount of manure and fertilizers. Well rotten farmyard manure or compost (200-250 q/ha) should be incorporated at the time of field preparation. The crop should be supplemented with 100-120 kg nitrogen and 50-60 kg each of phosphorus and potash hybrid requires more amount of fertilizers. Full dose of phosphorus and potash and half of N is applied at the of final field preparation before transplanting and the remaining quantity of N as urea is applied in two to three splits after 30, 45 and 60 days of transplanting in the farm of top dressing.
    <br><br>
    Sowing Time
    <br><br>
