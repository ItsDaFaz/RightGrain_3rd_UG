      <h1 class="w3-center">About Potato</h1><br>


      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum. In many contexts, potato refers to the edible tuber, but it can also refer to the plant itself.[2] Common or slang terms include tater, tattie and spud. Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.</p>

  <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">

    Potato (alu) edible tuber of the cultivated plant Solanum tuberosum of the family Solanaceae. It was the major crop for the original Americans. It is now one of the staple foods in Bangladesh. Its history is difficult to trace, partly because the name potato was also used by early writers for the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and for other unrelated plants. Spanish explorers are believed to have brought it in the 16th century from Peru to Spain, whence it spread north and west throughout Europe. European settlers brought it to North America probably around 1600 AD; thus, like the closely related tomato, it was a food plant reintroduced to the New World. Potato was first accepted as a large-scale crop in the British Isles.
<br>
<br>
    It became the major food in Ireland during the 18th century and is hence often called Irish potato to distinguish it from the sweet potato. Potato was also important for 20th century Europe, especially for Germany, where it kept the country alive during two world wars. With its high carbohydrate content, potato is today a primary food of Western peoples, as well as a source of starch, flour, alcohol, dextrin, and fodder (chiefly in Europe, where more is used for this purpose than for human consumption). It grows best in a cool, moist climate; the greatest potato producing counties are the United States (mostly in Maine and Idaho), Germany, Russia, Holland, and Poland.
<br>
<br>
    It is not known exactly when potato was introduced in this subcontinent. It is assumed that at the beginning of the 17th century the Portuguese navigators first brought potato to India. The first record about the cultivation of potato in India is seen in an 1847 issues of The Gardening Monthly, a magazine published from London. Initially, potato was cultivated in areas around Calcutta, from there its cultivation spread to Cherapunjee. When Warren Hastings was the governor (1772-1785), potato cultivation spread to many provinces of India, including Bombay, through his initiatives.

    The potato plant is a herbaceous annual, normally propagated by planting pieces of tubers that bear two or three eyes. Nutritionally, the tuber is rich in carbohydrates or starch and is a good source of protein, vitamin C and the B vitamins, potassium, phosphorus, and iron. Most of the minerals and protein are concentrated in a thin layer beneath the skin, and the skin itself is a source of food fibre.

  <h1 class="w3-xxlarge" color="white">Cultivation</h1>

  <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">

    Potato is widely cultivated in all the districts of Bangladesh during winter. Of the total 3,36,740 acres (1,36,332 ha) of land used for potato cultivation during 1997-98, 1,13,540, 2,18,445, and 4,755 acres were for local, high yielding, and Indian varieties respectively. Well-fertilized, sunny land with sufficient moisture in soil is appropriate for potato plantation. The first fortnight of November is the right time. In certain northwestern areas, farmers even plant potato in October to harvest the crop early. Virtually all potatoes in this country are planted manually. On the basis of the soil quality and potato variety farmers determine the spacing in between the seed tubers and the adjacent rows. Row spacing is usually from 45 to 60 cm. Optimum depth of planting depends on temperature and moisture of the soil, probable weather following planting, and mode of conducting field operations later. If planting is shallow and only about 5 cm deep, the soil must be gradually ridged over the row incidental to cultivation. This ensures that the developing tubers are well covered with soil to protect them from light and pests. Mulching is frequently done over the rows with waterhyacinth, straw etc to preserve the soil moisture and to prevent the growth of weeds.
